# Nordigen/GoCardless Open Banking API Playground

Nordigen/GoCardless provides a platform for accessing financial data through open banking standards.

This Python script is just me playing around with the Nordigen/GoCardless Open Banking API. This script demonstrates how to interact with the API and retrieve account information, and is incorporating Selenium for web-browser interactions. There is of course more you can do with the API, but this is just touching the surface. 

This script in NOT built using the existig python SDK, but can easily be refactored to using it.

Prerequisites:
- Obtain API credentials from Nordigen/GoCardless.
- Update the credentials section in `config.ini` 
- Pip3 install all the requirements
- Run `python3 open_banking.py
